# titanicML

Hello, 

This notebook is my first Machine Learning project that I made by myself. 

I believe that I could work a little bit more in the data preprocessing and I will do it in the future!

I've used random forest classifier to predict and I have got 96,3% of accuracy.

Thanks for taking a look and I'm open for suggestions and tips!
